## Technical Details

### Critical Implementation Notes

#### Block Comparison Logic
```php
// WYSIWYG blocks - normalize and compare content
if ($block['type'] === 'wysiwyg') {
    $current = trim(wp_kses_post($current_content));
    $new = trim(wp_kses_post($new_content));
    $changed = ($current !== $new);
}
// Other blocks - use strict serialization
else {
    $changed = (serialize($current) !== serialize($new));
}
```

#### Change Detection Hierarchy
1. Block count changes
2. Block type changes
3. Content-specific comparison for WYSIWYG
4. Index preservation for block order

### Prevention Measures
1. Never use direct serialization for WYSIWYG content
2. Always normalize before comparison
3. Preserve intentional whitespace
4. Track content length changes
5. Verify block count consistency
6. Maintain block type integrity
7. Handle empty content cases
8. Verify after every save
9. Compare normalized content
10. Log all state changes

## Known Issues
- Some WYSIWYG content persistence issues remain
- Preview generation may be slow with large content
- PDF generation system requires updates

## Upgrade Instructions

2. Update to version 2.3.2.4
